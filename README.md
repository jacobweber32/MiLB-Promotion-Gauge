# MiLB-Promotion-Gauge

A nuanced rolling gauge for how ready a position player is to be promoted accounting just for batting stats. Takes account of positional offensive requirements, age comparative to levels average, varying requirements dependent on level, and hot and cold streaks.

Without public access to game-by-game defensive ratings and baserunning data, I incorporated the use of the 20/80 scale to give points for these aspects of the game.

Additionally, I added a way to display how ready a player would be if they changed positions.

10/25 - Added functionality over multiple seasons in addition to counting full season results
